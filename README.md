# 📍 Location

**Location** is a lightweight Minecraft Spigot/Paper plugin designed for **solo survival worlds**.  
It lets you record, view, and track your own waypoints — without teleportation or cheats.  
The goal is to keep it simple, immersive, and always up to date with the latest Minecraft versions.
